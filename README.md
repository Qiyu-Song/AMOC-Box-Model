# AMOC-Box-Model
This is a box model for simulating Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is a main cause of thousand-year scale climate variability. This project uses ODE methods to calculate global climate change, including global atmosphere and the Atlantic Ocean. An experiment of adding fresh water into North Atlantic is also performed.
